# Auto-byteswitching IDE Adapter for the Atari Falcon

44-pin 2mm pitch IDE host to two device adapter supporting cable select with automatic physical byte swapping

## Atari Falcon

This adapter is intended for use in my Atari Falcon which has an 44-pin 2mm-pitch IDE connection soldered to the board with only one connector for a hard disc.

This allows two discs to be added to the Falcon, if they support running in master/slave configuration, either via jumpers on the discs, or via cable select, which this board supports.

## Byte Swap

This board also automatically swaps data bytes which a suitable hard disc driver on the atari can make use of for faster interoperability with modern machines.
